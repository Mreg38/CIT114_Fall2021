# CIT 114 Week 7 (Notes 05: Networking & Content Delivery)
## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 6
### Cloud Security

#### What is a Network?

A computer network is just two or more client machines that are connected together, using a network device, to share resources. A network can be logically partitioned to create subnets. A router or switch are used to connect the clients together and enable communications.

#### Definitions for Computer Networking

Computer Network - is the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.

There are also multiple devices or mediums which helps in the communication between two different devices which are known as Network devices. Ex: Router, Switch, Hub, Bridge.

The layout pattern using which devices are interconnected is called as network topology. Such as Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, Daisy chain.

OSI - stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.

The OSI Model layers are as follows: (Anagram: All People Seem To Need Data Processing)
   * Layer 7 - Application
The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application.
   * Layer 6 - Presentation
The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them.
   * Layer 5 - Session
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.
   * Layer 4 - Transport
The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
   * Layer 3 - Network
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one node to another connected in "different networks".
   * Layer 2 - Data Link
The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes
   * Layer 1 - Physical
Responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium.
