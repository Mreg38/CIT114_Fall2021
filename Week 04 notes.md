# CIT 114 Week 4
## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 4
### Cloud Economics, Billing & Support

#### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Ability to let one optimize costs to match needs, even as needs change
- Pay-as-you-go (on demand), reservation-based and bulk-use (pay less when you use more) payment models

#### Key Principles of Pricing
3 Fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:
```
- Compute
- Storage
- Outbound data transfer
```
- Start early with cost optimization
- Maximize the power of flexiblity
- Use the right pricing model for the job

#### The right pricing model for the job
- On Demand: pay for tcompute or database capacity with no long-term commitments or upfront payments
- Dedicated Instances (available with Amazon [Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)) (Amazon EC2): run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.
- Spot Instances: an Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism that lets you purchase spare computing capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates
- Reservations: provide you with the ablity to receiver a greater discount by paying for capacity ahead of time.
