### Notes 07: Storage

#### What is Storage?

Before you can choose what type of storage you should use with a cloud computing provider, you first need to understand what is storage. Storage is basically a technology that allows a user to retain digital data onto a medium. It is one of the core components of a computer and in cloud computing, something that you need to understand the differences.

In a computer, there are two types of storage: Volatile and Non-Volatile.

Volatile memory - is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted. For example, RAM is volatile. When you are working on a document, it is kept in RAM, and if the computer loses power, your work will be lost. For this reason, you should save your document to a file on a non-volatile storage medium, such as your hard drive.

NV or Non-volatile - memory is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. It is also called persistent storage or permanent storage. An example of non-volatile memory and storage is a computer hard drive, flash memory, and ROM. If data is stored on a hard drive, it will remain on that drive regardless if the power is interrupted, which is why it is the best place to store your data and documents. Non-volatile memory also stores your computer's time and system settings even when the power is off.

Local Storage Types

In computing, there is many forms of storage. Temporary storage, such as RAM, allows a computer to temporarily store information while the computer is in use, however when power is removed, the information stored in temporary storage is lost. Permanent storage is where you keep your operating system, applications, and other data files that you use on a computer system. The information will be saved even if there is no power to the system.

Read Only Memory (RAM)

As the computer boots, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory (RAM), which allows the CPU to process the instructions faster and speeds up the boot process. RAM is temporary storage that allows data and programs to be stored in memory in order the operating system to use them. After the operating system has booted up, each program you open, such as the browser you're using to view this page, is loaded into memory while it is running. If too many programs are open, the computer will swap the data in the memory between the RAM and the hard disk drive.

A computer's performance is largely attributed to the amount of memory contained within it. If a computer does not have the recommended memory to run the operating system and software programs being used, it will result in slower performance. The more memory a computer has, the more information and software it can load and process quickly.

Hard Drives

A hard drive can be used to store any data, including pictures, music, videos, text documents, and any files created or downloaded. Also, hard drives store files for the operating system and software programs that run on the computer. The two main types of hard drive are HDD (hard disk drive) and SSD (solid state drive).

|Topic|SSD|HDD|
|---|---|---|
|Access time|An SSD has access speeds of 35 to 100 microseconds.|A typical HDD takes about 5,000 to 10,000 microseconds to access data.|
|Price|The price of a solid-state drive is higher than an HDD, which is why most computers with an SSD only have a few hundred gigabytes of storage.|HDD is considerably cheaper than SSD, especially for drives over 1 TB.|
|Reliability|The SSD has no moving parts. It uses flash memory to store data, which provides better performance and reliability over an HDD.|The HDD has moving parts and magnetic platters, meaning the more use they get, the faster they wear down and fail.|
|Capacity|Although there are large SSDs, anything over 1 TB SSD is usually outside of most people's price range.|Several terabyte hard disk drives are available for very reasonable prices.|
|Power|The SSD uses less power than a standard HDD, which means a lower energy bill over time and for laptops, an increase in battery life.|With all of the parts required to spin the platters, the HDD uses more power than an SSD.|
|Noise|With no moving parts, SSD generates no noise.|With the spinning platters and moving read/write heads, an HDD can sometimes be one of the loudest components in your computer.|
|Heat|Because there are no moving parts and due to the nature of flash memory, the SSD generates less heat, helping to increase its lifespan and reliability.|With moving parts comes added heat which can slowly damage electronics over time, so the higher the heat, the greater the potential for wear and damage.|
|Magnetism|SSD is not affected by magnetism.|Because a hard drive relies on magnetism to write information to the platter, the information could be erased from an HDD using strong magnets.|

Optical Drive

Another common storage is optical storage, which uses lasers and lights as its method of reading and writing data. The three standards of optical media are CD (compact disk), DVD (digital versatile disk or digital video disk), and Blu-ray. All standards use the same size disc, but the data is read differently for each. Below is a table of data capacity for each standard.

|CD|DVD|Blu-ray|
|---|---|---|
|700 MB|Single-sided, single-layer: 4.7 GB Single-sided, double-layer: 8.5-8.7 GB Double-sided, single-layer: 9.4 GB Double-sided, double-layer: 17.08 GB|Single-layer disc: 25 GB Dual-layer disc: 50 GB|
