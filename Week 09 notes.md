### Notes 07: Storage

#### What is Storage?

Before you can choose what type of storage you should use with a cloud computing provider, you first need to understand what is storage. Storage is basically a technology that allows a user to retain digital data onto a medium. It is one of the core components of a computer and in cloud computing, something that you need to understand the differences.

In a computer, there are two types of storage: Volatile and Non-Volatile.

Volatile memory - is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted. For example, RAM is volatile. When you are working on a document, it is kept in RAM, and if the computer loses power, your work will be lost. For this reason, you should save your document to a file on a non-volatile storage medium, such as your hard drive.

NV or Non-volatile - memory is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. It is also called persistent storage or permanent storage. An example of non-volatile memory and storage is a computer hard drive, flash memory, and ROM. If data is stored on a hard drive, it will remain on that drive regardless if the power is interrupted, which is why it is the best place to store your data and documents. Non-volatile memory also stores your computer's time and system settings even when the power is off.

Local Storage Types

In computing, there is many forms of storage. Temporary storage, such as RAM, allows a computer to temporarily store information while the computer is in use, however when power is removed, the information stored in temporary storage is lost. Permanent storage is where you keep your operating system, applications, and other data files that you use on a computer system. The information will be saved even if there is no power to the system.
