## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 2
### Introducing Cloud Computing/Cloud Global Infrastructure

#### A Brief History
The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961:

If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone
system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.

#### Business Drivers
Capacity planning - the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.

Different capacity planning strategies exist:
   * Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
   * Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
   * Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases
