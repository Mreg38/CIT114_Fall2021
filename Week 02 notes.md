### Introducing Cloud Computing/Cloud Global Infrastructure

#### A Brief History
The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961:

If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone
system is a public utility... 


The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.
