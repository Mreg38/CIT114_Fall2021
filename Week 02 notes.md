# CIT 114 Week 2 (Notes 03: Cloud Global Infrastructure)
## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 2
### Introducing Cloud Computing/Cloud Global Infrastructure

#### A Brief History
The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961:

If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone
system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.

#### Business Drivers
Capacity planning:
The process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.

Different capacity planning strategies exist:
  * Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
  * Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
  * Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases

Cost Reduction:
Two costs need to be accounted for: the cost of acquiring new infrastructure, and the cost of its ongoing ownership. Operational overhead represents a considerable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up-front investment costs.

Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead include the following:
  * technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
  * upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
  * utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
  * security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
  * administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements

Organizational Agility:
The measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.

#### Concepts and Terminology
Cloud - refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources

IT resource - a physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software based, such as a virtual server or a custom software program, or hardware-based, such as a physical server or a network device

On-Premise - a way of stating "on the premises of a controlled IT environment that is not cloud-based." This term is used to qualify an IT resource as an alternative to "cloud-based." An IT resource that is on-premise cannot be cloud-based, and vice-versa.

Scaling - the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands.
The following are types of scaling:
  * Horizontal Scaling - scaling out and scaling in
  * Vertical Scaling - scaling up and scaling down
