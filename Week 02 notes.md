### Introducing Cloud Computing/Cloud Global Infrastructure

#### A Brief History
The idea of computing in a "cloud" traces back to the origins of utility computing, a concept that computer scientist John McCarthy publicly proposed in 1961:

If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone
system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.

#### Business Drivers
Capacity planning:
The process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.

Different capacity planning strategies exist:
  * Lead Strategy - adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand
  * Lag Strategy - adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity
  * Match Strategy - adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases

Cost Reduction:
Two costs need to be accounted for: the cost of acquiring new infrastructure, and the cost of its ongoing ownership. Operational overhead represents a considerable share of IT budgets, often exceeding up-front investment costs.

Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead include the following:
  * technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
  * upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
  * utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
  * security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
  * administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements

Organizational Agility:
The measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.

#### Concepts and Terminology
Cloud - refers to a distinct IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources

IT resource - a physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software based, such as a virtual server or a custom software program, or hardware-based, such as a physical server or a network device

On-Premise - a way of stating "on the premises of a controlled IT environment that is not cloud-based." This term is used to qualify an IT resource as an alternative to "cloud-based." An IT resource that is on-premise cannot be cloud-based, and vice-versa.

Scaling - the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands.

The following are types of scaling:
  * Horizontal Scaling - scaling out and scaling in (allocating or releasing of IT resources that are of the same type is referred to as horizontal scaling)
  * Vertical Scaling - scaling up and scaling down (existing IT resource is replaced by another with higher or lower capacity, vertical scaling)

Cloud Service - is any IT resource that is made remotely accessible via a cloud. Unlike other IT fields that fall under the service technology umbrella - such as service-oriented architecture - the term "service" within the context of cloud computing is especially broad

Cloud service consumer - a temporary runtime role assumed by a software program when it accesses a cloud service.

#### Goals and Benefits

Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs

Common measurable beneﬁts to cloud consumers include:
  * On-demand access to pay-as-you-go computing resources on a short-term basis (such as processors by the hour), and the ability to release these computing resources when they are no longer needed.
  * The perception of having unlimited computing resources that are available on demand, thereby reducing the need to prepare for provisioning.
  * The ability to add or remove IT resources at a ﬁne-grained level, such as modifying available storage disk space by single gigabyte increments.
  * Abstraction of the infrastructure so applications are not locked into devices or locations and can be easily moved if needed.

Increased Scalability

By providing pools of IT resources, along with tools and technologies designed to leverage them collectively, clouds can instantly and dynamically allocate IT resources to cloud consumers, on-demand or via the cloud consumer's direct conﬁguration.

Increased Availability and Reliability

A hallmark of the typical cloud environment is its intrinsic ability to provide extensive support for increasing the availability of a cloud-based IT resource to minimize or even eliminate outages, and for increasing its reliability so as to minimize the impact of runtime failure conditions.
Specifically:
  * An IT resource with increased availability is accessible for longer periods of time (for example, 22 hours out of a 24 hour day). Cloud providers generally offer "resilient" IT resources for which they are able to guarantee high levels of availability.
  * An IT resource with increased reliability is able to better avoid and recover from exception conditions. The modular architecture of cloud environments provides extensive failover support that increases reliability.

#### From Google's Perspective

1. Cloud computing is user-centric
2. Cloud computing is task-centric
3. Cloud computing is powerful
4. Cloud computing is accessible
5. Cloud computing is intelligent
6. Cloud computing is programmable
