### Cloud Security

#### What is Cyber Security?

Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of information. It seems that everything relies on computers and the internet now—communication (e.g., email, smartphones, tablets), entertainment 
(e.g., interactive video games, social media, apps ), transportation (e.g., navigation systems), shopping (e.g., online shopping, credit cards), medicine 
(e.g., medical equipment, medical records), and the list goes on.

What are the risks to having poor cybersecurity?

Dangers are malware erasing your entire system, an attacker breaking into your system and altering files, an attacker using your computer to attack others, or an 
attacker stealing your credit card information and making unauthorized purchases. There is no guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won't 
happen to you, but there are steps you can take to minimize the chances.

Terms to better understand the risks:
  * Hacker, attacker, or intruder – These terms are applied to the people who seek to exploit weaknesses in software and computer systems for their own gain. Although 
their intentions are sometimes benign and motivated by curiosity, their actions are typically in violation of the intended use of the systems they are exploiting
  * Malicious code – Malicious code (also called malware) is unwanted files or programs that can cause harm to a computer or compromise data stored on a 
computer. Various classifications of malicious code include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
      
      Malicious code may have the following characteristics:
      * It might require you to actually do something before it infects your computer. This action could be opening an email attachment or going to a particular webpage.
      * Some forms of malware propagate without user intervention and typically start by exploiting a software vulnerability. Once the victim computer has been infected, 
      the malware will attempt to find and infect other computers. This malware can also propagate via email, websites, or network-based software.
      * Some malware claims to be one thing, while in fact doing something different behind the scenes. For example, a program that claims it will speed up your computer 
      may actually be sending confidential information to a remote intruder.
