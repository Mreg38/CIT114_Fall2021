1. What are the advantages of cloud computing over on-premises?

       you and per-user basis.
     - More secure: Cloud services invest a lot in the protection and integirty of data. Less need for on-premises staff to need to keep up to date on security 
       and encryption.
     - Accessing data anytime: Being able to work away from the office when needed or just the abliity to keep up to date.
