# CIT 114 Week 1
## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 1
### Introduction to Information Technology

#### Current and Future needs for IT specialist:
1. Data overload - Being able to process large amounts of data
2. Mobile and Wireless Usage - Working with smartphones, tablets and laptops using hotspots and other roaming ability devices
3. Cloud Services - Many businesses no longer operate their own "server farms" and use third-party hosting platforms to maintain data
4. Bandwith for Video - Video conferencing has become more popular so more network bandwidth is needed to support them

#### The Four Pillars of an IT Framework:
1. Infrastructure - hardware and software that a network runs on
2. Development - creation and maintanance of software applications
3. Security - prevents unauthoraized access to assets either through hardware or software
4. Data - information stored in various ways (ie video, word doc, web pages etc) can count as bothe hardware and software. software accesses data and hardware stores it.

#### Jobs Roles & Occupations
- Computer and Information Research Scientists - invent and design new approaches to computing technology and find innovative uses for existing technology.
- Computer Network Architects - design and build data communication networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and Intranets.
- Computer Programmers - write and test code that allows computer applications and software programs to function properly.
- Computer Support Specialists - provide help and advice to computer users and organizations.
- Computer Systems Analysts - study an organization’s current computer systems and find a solution that is more efficient and effective.
- Database Administrators (DBAs) - use specialized software to store and organize data.
- Information Security Analysts - plan and carry out security measures to protect an organization’s computer networks and systems.
- Network and Computer Systems Administrators - responsible for the day-to-day operation of computer networks.
- Software Developers - create the applications or systems that run on a computer or another device.
- Web Developers - design and create websites.

- BIOS - Basic Input/Output System - program pre-ihstalled on Windows-based computers to start up. CPU accesses the BIOS before OS is loaded. BIOS then checks hardware connections and locates all device. If everything is OK, BIOS loads the OS into the computer's memory and finishes the boot-up process.

#### Motherboard form factors/sizes
- Standard-ATX
- Micro-ATX
- Mini-ATX
- Nano-ATX
