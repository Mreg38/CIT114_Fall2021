# CIT 114 Week 1
## Here are some important thinkgs I learned in Week 1
### Introduction to Information Technology

#### 3 primary pillars of responsibility for an IT department:
1. IT governance: The combination of policies and processes that ensure IT systems are effectively run and in alignment with the organization’s needs.
2. IT operations: The daily work of an IT department. This includes providing tech support, network maintenance, security testing and device management duties.
3. Hardware and infrastructure: The physical components of IT infrastructure. This pillar of IT includes the setup and maintenance of equipment like routers, servers, phone systems and individual devices like laptops.

#### Current and Future needs for IT specialist:
1. Data overload - Being able to process large amounts of data
2. Mobile and Wireless Usage - Working with smartphones, tablets and laptops using hotspots and other roaming ability devices
3. Cloud Services - Many businesses no longer operate their own "server farms" and use third-party hosting platforms to maintain data
4. Bandwith for Video - Video conferencing has become more popular so more network bandwidth is needed to support them

#### The Four Pillars of an IT Framework:
1. Infrastructure - hardware and software that a network runs on
2. Development - creation and maintanance of software applications
3. Security - prevents unauthoraized access to assets either through hardware or software
4. Data - information stored in various ways (ie video, word doc, web pages etc) can count as bothe hardware and software. software accesses data and hardware stores it.

#### Jobs Roles & Occupations
- Computer and Information Research Scientists - invent and design new approaches to computing technology and find innovative uses for existing technology.
- Computer Network Architects - design and build data communication networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and Intranets.
- Computer Programmers - write and test code that allows computer applications and software programs to function properly.
- Computer Support Specialists - provide help and advice to computer users and organizations.
- Computer Systems Analysts - study an organization’s current computer systems and find a solution that is more efficient and effective.
- Database Administrators (DBAs) - use specialized software to store and organize data.
- Information Security Analysts - plan and carry out security measures to protect an organization’s computer networks and systems.
- Network and Computer Systems Administrators - responsible for the day-to-day operation of computer networks.
- Software Developers - create the applications or systems that run on a computer or another device.
- Web Developers - design and create websites.

#### Important Skills and Knowledge:
- IT Professional - important to understand all aspects of computer components.
- Cloud computing - important to understand the components specifically related to the CPU, RAM, Storage, and Expansion Cards like Graphic Cards (GPU).

- Candidates who are best suited for IT work are those who have strong communication skills.**
- Have a level of empathy that allows them to see exactly what a client or co-worker is dealing with and calmly help them achieve their goal or solve a problem.
- Able to break down a large problem or an end goal into multiple steps.
- Positive attitude and passion for technology.

#### Hardware vs. software:
- Hardware includes all the physical parts of a computer system.
- Software encompasses all the data, application and programs stored electronically, like an operating system.
How to find limitations, pros/cons of what should be upgraded with best cost to efficiency ratio?

#### Computer Components/Terminology:
- Motherboard - main circuit board and is what connects other parts of the computer through integrated circuitry
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) - primary componet of a computer that processes instructions. Runs OS and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active program
- Random Access Memory (RAM) - when a program is opened it gets loaded from the hard drive into the RAM. Reading from RAM is faster than reading from the drive allowing them to function without lag time. Can be more helpful to add RAM than upgrading CPU.
- Storage:
    - Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
    - Solid State Drive (SSD)
- Expansion Cards:
    - Graphic Cards (GPU)
    - Audio Cards
    - Networking Components
    - TV Tuners
    - USB Cards
    - Video Capture
- Cooling:
    - Fan
    - Heat Sink
    - Liquid Cooling
- Power Supply
- Case
- Input & Output Devices
    - Keyboard
    - Mouse
    - Monitor
    - Printer

- BIOS - Basic Input/Output System - program pre-ihstalled on Windows-based computers to start up. CPU accesses the BIOS before OS is loaded. BIOS then checks hardware connections and locates all device. If everything is OK, BIOS loads the OS into the computer's memory and finishes the boot-up process.

#### Motherboard form factors/sizes:
- Standard-ATX
- Micro-ATX
- Mini-ATX
- Nano-ATX
- Pico-ATX
